# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer
`Outside promise` prints first, because its root line of code 
```js 
console.log()
```
is a synchronous line of code in the global execution context. Meaning, it is out on a megalist of code that is prioritized to run first, in order from top down. the promise, even though it comes first, is an asynchronous piece of code. Therefore, it's placed second in line to run after the synchronous piece of code.
