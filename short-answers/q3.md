# Question
With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling *and* returning them

# Answer
b. Calling *and* returning them. the Promise.resolve() method is a way to create a promise without having to depend on other async operations, and creates a value regargless indicating that the promise was fulfilled. Promise.reject() produces an error when the promise was rejected for some reason. This error, is also a value.
