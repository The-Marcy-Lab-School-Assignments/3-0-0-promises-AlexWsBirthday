# Question
With `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, which of the following makes the promise produce a value?

a. calling `resolve()` or `reject()`

b. calling *and* returning them

# Answer
//**EDIT** thank u Madison//

a. Calling them. the Promise.resolve() method is a way to create a promise without having to depend on other async operations, and creates+returns a value indicating that the promise was fulfilled. Promise.reject() produces an error when the promise was rejected for some reason. This error, is also a value. Though we can return these values, doesn't mean we always should. You're going to return something regardless, however, whether you want to explicitly return the value produced or not is up to you.

You logic and intuition are on the right track. Let's clarify somethings:
In your response you are saying `resolve()` produces a value "regardless indicating that the promise was fulfilled". No where in here you mention anything about returning a value, just that it produces one, which is spot on.
You bring this point up when you talk about `reject()`. All of this to say that we do not have to return when we do either and a value is produced.
