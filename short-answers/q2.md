# Question
What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer
Both methods are used to return data from the promise. 

`.then` is best used for when a promise is fulfilled, and has data to be accessed or used to do something else with. Essentially, adding on to the promise. 

`.catch` is used to catch errors when a promise hasn't been fulfilled for one reason or another, to prevent the whole program from breaking.

Solid answer here. You just missed what the similarities are. I don't want to give it away, but they both handle something and they are both something. (hint hint...)
