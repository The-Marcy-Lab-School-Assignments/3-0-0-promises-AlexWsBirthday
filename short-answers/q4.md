# Question
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer
Resolve/Reject are objects produced by a promise, that tell you whether a promise was either fulfilled or rejected. This could be a simple string that is printed to the console when a promise runs smoothly, or an error message that's printed to the console

# Teacher Feedback
All of this is right! Just want to make sure that we also mention here that when a promise is fulfilled, it can be that it returns a value as well, not just printing to the console.
